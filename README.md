# Deno 2 with Deno KV Starter Template for Railway

A production-ready starter template showcasing Deno KV with a web interface.
While Railway's default runtime doesn't support Deno 2 yet, this template
provides a custom Docker configuration to ensure full compatibility.

This repo is also ready for Github Codespaces.

## Features

- üåê **Web Interface**: Simple HTTP server with HTML and JSON endpoints
- üóÑÔ∏è **Deno KV Storage**: Deno's built-in persistent key-value store based on
  Sqlite in folder /db.
- üöÇ **Railway Ready**: Configured for easy deployment
