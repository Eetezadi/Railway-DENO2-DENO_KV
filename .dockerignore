# This file specifies which files and directories should be excluded when building
# the Docker image on Railway. Files listed here won't be copied into the Docker build context,
# resulting in faster and cleaner production environment without development-only files.

# Note: Patterns work similar to .gitignore:

# Database files (the production database is on Railway)
db/
*.db
*.db-shm
*.db-wal

# Version control
.git
.gitignore

# Environment files
.env

# Development files
*_test.ts
README.md
LICENSE

# Dependency lock files
deno.lock

# IDE and editor files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
